This is a Learning management system for a high school that conducts intake assessments before accepting learners into the school. The system accomodates guests which are people who not part of the school. The guest can read about the school, contact the school and book a day to write the intake assessment. This system solves the problem of high paper work and additional marking and admin from the school staff.
